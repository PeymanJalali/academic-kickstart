summary: >
    The problem of joint estimation of multiple graphical models from high dimensional data is ubiquitous
    in diverse fields including molecular biology, neuroscience and the social sciences. The
    main task is to formulate a methodology that allows us to borrow strength from the joint data to
    estimate edges that are common between any combination of the groups. To that end, we develop
    a Bayesian approach that decomposes the model parameters across the multiple graphical
    models into shared components across subsets of models and edges. This goal is achieved by
    constructing a novel multivariate prior distribution, coupled with a pseudo-likelihood that enables
    fast computations through a robust and efficient Gibbs sampling scheme. We establish strong posterior
    consistency for model selection and illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on both
    synthetic and real data.

summary: >
    Sparse estimation of the precision matrix under high-dimensional scaling constitutes a canonical
    problem in statistics and machine learning literature. For solving this problem, Bayesian methods
    are of particular interest as they provide direct uncertainty quantification of the model parameters
    through the posterior distribution which allows us to perform hypotheses testing and/or construct
    confidence intervals for the parameters of interest. However, estimating a medium size (1000 by 1000)
    precision matrix, using the fastest existing Bayesian method, takes over 285 days and over 50 Gb
    of memory. To address this weakness, we develop a Bayesian methodology which does
    the same job in 45 minutes and using less than 0.4 Gb of memory. In addition to establishing
    model selection and estimation consistency under high-dimensional scaling, we demonstrate
    through extensive numerical studies that our model is computationally more accurate than existing
    Bayesian and frequentist methods.
