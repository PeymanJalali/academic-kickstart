# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: >
    The problem of joint estimation of multiple graphical models from high dimensional data is ubiquitous
    in diverse fields including molecular biology, neuroscience and the social sciences. The
    main task is to formulate a methodology that allows us to borrow strength from the joint data to
    estimate edges that are common between any combination of the groups. To that end, we develop
    a Bayesian approach that decomposes the model parameters across the multiple graphical
    models into shared components across subsets of models and edges. This goal is achieved by
    constructing a novel multivariate prior distribution, coupled with a pseudo-likelihood that enables
    fast computations through a robust and efficient Gibbs sampling scheme. We establish strong posterior
    consistency for model selection and illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach on both
    synthetic and real data.
